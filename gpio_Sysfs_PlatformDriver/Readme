######################################################
A gpio platform driver that controls the user led pins of 
beaglebone black by using Linux gpio subsystem. Device 
entries are created under 'sysfs' soon the device is detected
and the same can be accessed (read/write) via sysfs.

gpio-sysfs.c :
============
This is source file for the driver code which
contains the driver init/exit code along with basic 
operations.

am335x-boneblack-lddpractice.dtsi
=================================
The device tree include file which contains the 
hardware information details of our user leds device.
This is included in the main 'am335x-boneblack.dts'
file.


am335x-bone-common.dtsi
=======================
The beagle bone black common dtsi file. It is needed
to be modified to be able to use led pins as by 
default same were being used by some other system.
we commented the code so that we can use these in our
driver.

am335x-boneblack.dts
====================
The main dts file. This needs to include - 
am335x-boneblack-lddpractice.dtsi so that modifications
related leds can be applied. A binary (dtb) has to be
created and put in /BOOT directory of SD card so that
kernel can get the HW info about leds during boot time.
Check 'Build commands' section below for the compilation
command.

Makefile:
========= 
This is makefile used to build the module.

Build command: 
=============
Following build command can be used to
build this module 'out of tree' for the linux version
of your host machine :

sudo make -C /lib/modules/5.19.0-46-generic/build M=$PWD modules

Note: Replace '5.19.0-46-generic' with your host linux
version (can be found by running 'uname -r')

Build the device tree binary:
============================
Run below command from kernel source directory:

$ sudo make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- am335x-boneblack.dtb

Load/Unload module:
==================
To load the module dynamically into your host kernel:
sudo insmod gpio-sysfs.ko

To unload:
sudo rmmod gpio-sysfs.ko (or only 'gpio-sysfs')
